# DebugIt-DietHawk
This is the Final repository for the DebugIt competition. It is Diet/Meal webapp where one can check nutrient value of the food

The website consists of a text search bar which allows user to add food ingredients/items one at a time and check their nutrition value all at once.
Secondly, it allows user to input number of kilocalories they want to intake and give a meal plan

The api used for the project is edamam developers api.

<--I had to upload routes folder and views folder because I had forgotten to upload them. I am sorry for the mistake-->

Link for the website.(The api used is a third party api and for reasons I don't know plays joke on me)
